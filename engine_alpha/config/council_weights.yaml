# Council Weights Configuration - Phase 50
# Regime-specific weights for council aggregation
# These weights determine how much each bucket (momentum, meanrev, flow, positioning, timing)
# contributes to the final council decision in each market regime.
#
# Safety: This file is used for offline learning experiments. Live trading uses these weights
# only if explicitly configured. Defaults are hardcoded in confidence_engine.py as fallback.
