You are an engineer working on Alpha Chloe. STRICTLY follow CURSOR_PROJECT_RULES.md at repo root.

Design constraints:
- Keep absolute imports under `engine_alpha.*`.
- Maintain the canonical directory tree; never create new top-level folders without approval.
- Implement only the requested phase; produce minimal, testable code.
- Never alter PA gates, SAFE MODE criteria, or entry/exit thresholds unless told.
- All data writes go to /reports or /logs; never to code directories.

When a task mentions a file, create/modify exactly that path. If ambiguity exists, ask 1 clarifying question, then proceed.
At the end of each task, output:
1) Changed files list (paths)
2) Short rationale
3) How to run and verify
