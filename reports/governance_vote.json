  "gpt_reason": "The system recommended \"REVIEW\" based on the following analysis of the provided scores:\n\n1. **Overall Score (sci)**: The overall score is 0.491, which is below the threshold typically required for a \"GO\" recommendation. This indicates that the overall performance is not strong enough to proceed without further evaluation.\n\n2. **Module Scores**:\n   - **Dream**: Score of 0.5 - This is a neutral score, indicating potential but not strong enough to drive a \"GO\" decision.\n   - **Evolver**: Score of 0.5 - Similar to Dream, this score suggests potential but lacks decisiveness.\n   - **Sandbox**: Score of 0.306 - This is a low score, indicating poor performance in this module, which negatively impacts the overall assessment.\n   - **Mirror**: Score of 0.658 - This is the highest score among the modules, indicating good performance, but it is not sufficient to outweigh the lower scores of the other modules.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Given the combination of scores, particularly the low performance in the Sandbox module and the overall score being below the threshold, the system determined that further review is necessary to assess potential improvements or adjustments before making a final decision.",
