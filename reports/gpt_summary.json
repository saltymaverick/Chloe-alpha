  "summary": "### Summary of Open Positions\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **Total Open Positions:** 2\n- **Position Direction:** \n  - Long: 0\n  - Short: 2\n- **Average Risk Multiplier:** 1.0\n- **Average Bars Open:** Approximately 7.31\n- **Last Open Timestamp:** November 9, 2025\n\n### Performance Analysis\n- **Position Direction:** The absence of long positions indicates a bearish market sentiment or strategy. The reliance on short positions may suggest a defensive approach in a declining market.\n- **Average Bars Open:** With an average of over 7 bars open, positions may be held longer than optimal, potentially leading to increased exposure to market volatility.\n\n### Recommendations for Adjustment\n1. **Review Position Strategy:**\n   - Assess market conditions to determine if maintaining a short-only strategy is appropriate.\n   - Consider diversifying by opening long positions if market indicators suggest potential upward movement.\n\n2. **Optimize Trade Duration:**\n   - Evaluate the average holding period of 7.31 bars. If positions are consistently underperforming, consider implementing tighter stop-loss orders or profit-taking strategies to reduce exposure.\n\n3. **Risk Management:**\n   - Maintain the current risk multiplier of 1.0 but review the risk management strategy to ensure it aligns with market conditions and personal risk tolerance.\n\n4. **Policy Review:**\n   - Given the recommendation to \"REVIEW,\" consider re-evaluating the policy parameters, especially regarding the allowance of new openings and position adjustments. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe current strategy of holding short positions may need reassessment based on market conditions. Adjustments in trade duration and diversification of positions could enhance performance and mitigate risks.",
